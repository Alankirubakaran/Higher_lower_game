# Higher_lower_game
This is a fun and interactive Python game where players are challenged to guess which of two celebrities, influencers, or notable figures has more followers on social media.
The game presents two choices, and the player has to decide which one has the higher follower count. Each round, the correct answer becomes the new "A" choice, while a new random figure is chosen as "B." 
The player continues to play until they get an answer wrong, at which point their score is displayed.
Randomized choices from a dataset of figures (names, descriptions, and follower counts).
Dynamic score tracking that increases with each correct answer.
Visual artwork (via the art module) to enhance the gameplay experience.
Game continues until the player answers incorrectly, displaying the final score.

Technologies:
Python
Random module
Data source: game_data.py (containing figures and their follower counts)
Art package for visuals

How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install necessary dependencies (if any, e.g., art).
